# Uncomment this section if you want to display forms with configurable

# If prior versions of your tile are installed and configured, their
# property values will not be overwritten by new defaults provided
# in this file. If that is your intent, you must do the overwriting
# explicitly using JavaScript migration functions, like so:
#
# migration: |
#   properties['properties']['.properties.org']['value'] = 'system';

# Bosh add-ons can be configured by adding runtime_configs to the
# tile.yml
#
# runtime_configs:

#       releases:
#       - name: os-conf

#       addons:

#         - name: MY-RUNTIME-CONFIG-JOB
#           release: os-conf
#         properties:
#           MY-ADDON-NAME:
#         ...
#
# Bosh releases referenced by add-ons must be either already present,
# or added to the tile separately using a package of type bosh-release.
