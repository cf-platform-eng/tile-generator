# Specify the packages to be included in your tile.
# The format of the section to include depends on the type

packages:
- name: my-application

  manifest:
    path: resources/my-application-1.0.0.jar
#   command: python app.py
#   memory: 256M

# Include stemcell criteria if you don't want to accept the default.
# Since this stemcell is only used to run pre and post errands, we
# strongly recommend you leave this alone so that your tile always
# runs with the latest stemcell.
#
# stemcell_criteria:
#   os: ubuntu-trusty
#   requires_cpi: false
#   version: '3062'

# Add properties you want to pass to your applications.
# Properties specified here will not be configurable by the user.

# - name: example_property
#   type: string

# Uncomment this section if you want to display forms with configurable
# properties in Ops Manager. These properties will be passed to your
# applications as environment variables. You can also refer to them
# elsewhere in this template by using:
#     (( .properties.<property-name> ))
# 
# forms:
# - name: buildpack_properties
#   label: Buildpack
#   description: Buildpack_properties

#     type: integer
#     default: 0
#     label: Buildpack rank for this buildpack_rank
#     description: Ranking of this buildpack relative to others

# Add any dependencies your tile has on other installed products.
# This is often appropriate when using automatic service provisioning
# for any of your packages above, with services provided by other
# products.
#
# requires_product_versions:
# - name: p-mysql
#   version: '~> 1.7'

# Customize upgrade parameters if the defaults don't meet your needs.

# If prior versions of your tile are installed and configured, their
# property values will not be overwritten by new defaults provided
# in this file. If that is your intent, you must do the overwriting
# explicitly using JavaScript migration functions, like so:
#
# migration: |
#   properties['properties']['.properties.org']['value'] = 'system';
